## UX
### Strategy
#### Agile
The Agile methodology was used to plan and create the project. Google sheets and Github were the tools used to demonstrate this.
1. Projects were used to divide the project into three iterations with a simple kanban board.
2. Milestones were used to create User Stories with a custom template.
3. Issues were used to create each individual User Story. Each story defines the title, statement, and acceptance criteria.

* Each user story was grouped into an Epic and placed within one of the three iterations.The User Stories were classified as 'must-have', 'could-have', & 'should-have' in order to priortise the work. As progress was made on each user story it was moved from 'to do' across to 'In Progress' column. When each user story wass complete it was moved across to 'done' column.

* However it was difficult in Github since the projects application changed, to adequately link iterations - Epic - User Stories. To help keep further track and make it easier to follow the Agile methodology I used Google Sheets to create a [project kanban board](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T_LNmWw8ennfcJeJCG63nfQmfHPUSE6cgO4ReGNBRmg/edit?usp=sharing) to track progress in the event Github Projects didn't fulfill the Agile requirements the project had. Although I linked User Stories (Issues) to Epics (Milestones) and placed these in Iterations (Milestones), Epics did not automatically show the % progress to completion once user stories were moved in the kanban board on Github projects.
