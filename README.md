## Context 
The Tipsy Tiger Cocktail Guide is a recipe style website, that displays cocktail recipes created and posted by users on the site. 

The website is simple:
- Non registered users can view the site and can register for an account in an easy process.
- Logged in users have a range of options available.
- User can view full page cocktail recipe details.
- User can create their own cocktail recipe.
- User can edit their own cocktail recipes
- User can delete their own cocktail recipes
- User can interact with other posts on the site in the form of comments or liking the cocktail

## UX

### Agile
The Agile methodology was used to plan and create the project. Google sheets and Github were the tools used to demonstrate this.
1. Projects were used to divide the project into three iterations with a simple kanban board.
2. Milestones were used to create User Stories with a custom template.
3. Issues were used to create each individual User Story. Each story defines the title, statement, and acceptance criteria.

* Each user story was grouped into an Epic and placed within one of the three iterations.The User Stories were classified as 'must-have', 'could-have', & 'should-have' in order to priortise the work. As progress was made on each user story it was moved from 'to do' across to 'In Progress' column. When each user story wass complete it was moved across to 'done' column.

* However it was difficult in Github since the projects application changed, to adequately link iterations - Epic - User Stories. To help keep further track and make it easier to follow the Agile methodology I used Google Sheets to create a [project kanban board](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T_LNmWw8ennfcJeJCG63nfQmfHPUSE6cgO4ReGNBRmg/edit?usp=sharing) to track progress in the event Github Projects didn't fulfill the Agile requirements the project had. Although I linked User Stories (Issues) to Epics (Milestones) and placed these in Iterations (Milestones), Epics did not automatically show the % progress to completion once user stories were moved in the kanban board on Github projects.

### Project Goal
* The goal of this project was to create a cocktail recipe site with tried and tested cocktails for get together's. As the world was separate for a while due to covid, socializing habits changed and more people stayed at home and entertained when it was safe to do so. While there is still a need for pubs and clubs, more and more home parties are being organized. From bbq's to baby showers and milestone birthday parties. With this in mind, The Tipsy Tiger Cocktails Guide was created. To help people add something special to the celebrations.

### Target audience

The target User is someone:
* Who wants to add a homemade cocktail to impress their guests.
* Who wants to be able to modifify and control alcohol limit in each drink.
* Who wants to add the personal touch to celebrations.
* Who wants to engage with others who have the same interest in cocktails.
* Who wants to share their own creations and recipes.

### Epics and User Stories

### Scope

The scope of the project was quiet extensive at the beginning. The over all goal was to give users full CRUD on all of their content. Due to time constraints this meant user's only had CRUD functionality on cocktail recipes and as this was deemed a must have and took priorty. More functionality for logged in users will be added in the future. Further front-end admin functions will be added as this project is limited to back-end django admin panel. 

## Features
### Structure 
The website consists of six pages:

* Currently images can be uploaded to the recipe form from the user's own computer or by a url. This could be further defined by size and image type to ensure consistancy throughout the site.

### Design 

### Flowchart
 * I designed a basic flowchart on [Lucid Chart](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/8619b2ff-1840-4d3a-b234-ac143540d744/edit?page=0_0&invitationId=inv_9469ea28-80f3-48d1-943c-643df72710da#) first.This was to give me a template to follow and to make sure my original design that I had planned was the outcome and final layout of the application. This was an essential piece to the project along side the epics and user stories as it helped me keep track of how the application would be displayed to the user and the steps the user would take within the application.

- How would the flow of the website be laid out?
- How would I deal unregistered users?
- What benefits where there for registered and logged in users?

 ### WireFrames
I designed a basic wireframe to compliment the Epics, User stories and flow chart.This was to give me a template to follow and to make sure my original design that I had planned was the outcome and final layout of the application. Some feature have been change due to time constraints.

### Data Models
There are two models used for the database: A recipe model and a comment model.

![](documentation/wireframes/Data-models.png)
*Data Model*

The googlesheet of these models can be found [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C02nlF7PXHJwVVeX6fccqtWrPZb4RqBYxgY8-sqb3lQ/edit?usp=sharing)


### Colors
The following colors palette was used through the site.

![](documentation/User-story-ss/ux-colors.png)

* The main background color is RGB(248, 248, 248). I wanted a clean muted background color as the main images on the site would be colorful and eye catching. It is a soft muted white to take the harshness of pure white and soften the users visual experience.

* The main text body is RGB(33, 37, 46), a shade of navy for the large important text on the site. I choose navy as it wasn't as harsh as black and still noticable to the user.

* The nav-bar hover, cocktail titles, cocktail info are all RGB(115, 112, 112). A soft grey to contrast against the main background color. 

* The predominant color of RGB(208, 98, 1) was choosen to reference back to the site logo but on a muted softer scale. All action buttons, links and text underline are this shade of orange. This choice was made to tie all the pages together and on pages like registration form where it is quite neutral, it gives a small pop of color.

### Fonts
* The fonts chosen for the site were:[Itim](https://fonts.google.com/?query=itim) the nav-bar and recipe titles.[Architects Daughter](https://fonts.google.com/?query=architects+daughter)
