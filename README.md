## UX

### Agile
The Agile methodology was used to plan and create the project. Google sheets and Github were the tools used to demonstrate this.
1. Projects were used to divide the project into three iterations with a simple kanban board.
2. Milestones were used to create User Stories with a custom template.
3. Issues were used to create each individual User Story. Each story defines the title, statement, and acceptance criteria.

* Each user story was grouped into an Epic and placed within one of the three iterations.The User Stories were classified as 'must-have', 'could-have', & 'should-have' in order to priortise the work. As progress was made on each user story it was moved from 'to do' across to 'In Progress' column. When each user story wass complete it was moved across to 'done' column.

* However it was difficult in Github since the projects application changed, to adequately link iterations - Epic - User Stories. To help keep further track and make it easier to follow the Agile methodology I used Google Sheets to create a [project kanban board](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T_LNmWw8ennfcJeJCG63nfQmfHPUSE6cgO4ReGNBRmg/edit?usp=sharing) to track progress in the event Github Projects didn't fulfill the Agile requirements the project had. Although I linked User Stories (Issues) to Epics (Milestones) and placed these in Iterations (Milestones), Epics did not automatically show the % progress to completion once user stories were moved in the kanban board on Github projects.

### Project Goal
* The goal of this project was to create a cocktail recipe site with tried and tested cocktails for get together's. As the world was separate for a while due to covid, socializing habits changed and more people stayed at home and entertained when it was safe to do so. While there is still a need for pubs and clubs, more and more home parties are being organized. From bbq's to baby showers and milestone birthday parties. With this in mind, The Tipsy Tiger Cocktails Guide was created. To help people add something special to the celebrations.
The target User is someone:
* Who wants to add a homemade cocktail to impress their guests.
* Who wants to be able to modifify and control alcohol limit in each drink.
* Who wants to add the personal touch to celebrations.
* Who wants to engage with others who have the same interest in cocktails.
* Who wants to share their own creations and recipes.

### Epics and User Stories 
In order to efficently build the site, 10 Epics and 19 user stories were created to cover all the bases of the final site. 
1. Epic: Set up an admin page to manage posts, reviews, comments and user with comments.

* User Stories: 
    * As an admin I can post content so that there is a decent library of recipes.[#1](https://github.com/Charte-dot/The-Tipsy-Tiger-cg/issues/1)

    * As an admin I can approve content so that the it's only relevant content posted[#2](https://github.com/Charte-dot/The-Tipsy-Tiger-cg/issues/2)

    * As an admin I can approve reviews so that I can filter inappropriate content[#3](https://github.com/Charte-dot/The-Tipsy-Tiger-cg/issues/3)
