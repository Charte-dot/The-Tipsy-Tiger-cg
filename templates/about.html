            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p> Here at the Tipsy Tiger Cocktail Guide, we strive to bring people together over the love of
                cocktails.
                We started as a group of friends that got together every friday to celebrate the end of the working
                week.
                So during Covid lockdown as everyone's social activities were put on hold and we stayed all bundled up
                safe at home,
                our socialization platform as friends changed but we still continued to celebrate the end of the week.
                After a Few friday's, lots of cocktail trial and errors and zoom calls, The Tipsy Tiger Cocktail Guide
                was born.
            </p>
            <p>Our mission is to bring this small coummunity of together over our mutual love of cocktails and
                socializing with friends.
