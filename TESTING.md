```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

## Responsiveness
The website was developed on a 15" laptop and a 24" monitor and no issues were found.

Chrome Developer tools were used to check responsiveness on all sized devices throughout the process and adjustments were made.

Additional tests were conducted in the later stages on various mobile devices: 
* Moto G8+
* IPhone 11
* Iphone SE2 
* IPhone XR.

## Bugs 
### Resolved 
1. On the smaller screen, the drop down menu was appearing behind the hero image. I troubleshooted this with help of [developer.mozilla docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index) and found a solution of adding 'z-index 100' to css on nav bar nav for dropdown menu on smaller screens.
2. The logo when added to the nav bar brand, wasn't responding to css re-sizing. By using bootstrap I managed to re-size the logo to fit in the nav bar by entering the width and height into img scr tag.
3. While testing, I had a number of <a> tags with in a button. W3C called this as an error. Upon changing out <a> tags with buttons class with in the tag. This resolved the issue of button errors on html checker.

## Unresolved
1. The nav bar is styled to highlight when a user hovers over the nav link. I had the nav bar set to stay highlighted on the link once a user chooses that page.
The nav active was only highlighting the 'about page' and 'mycocktails page' and other pages of home, coctails, register, sign-in, sign-out wouldn't stay highlighted once the link was clicked.

This bug is still unresolved as after thorough testing and code review, I cannot find what is blocking and interacting with certain links and preventing them from staying highlighted once active.

## HTML validation issues
**Cocktail Filter**
* When passing through the html for cocktails page, W3C validator threw up errors from the filter in which the template is provided by django filter form. In order to validate the html I had to code out the filter and pass through the code again.
